# MAGIC # Tracing a custom agent, end to end — Monte Carlo forecasting chat
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A team of forecasters converses with a Monte Carlo simulation. The agent
# MAGIC (`agent.py`) is a small MLflow **ResponsesAgent**: the LLM decides when to run a
# MAGIC simulation, we execute it locally, and the model explains the result. The point of
# MAGIC this notebook is the **observability**, not the model. It walks the four things you
# MAGIC need to make tracing real on Databricks *today*:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | | What | How |
# MAGIC |---|---|---|
# MAGIC | **a** | Framework autolog + a tool span | `mlflow.openai.autolog()` + `@mlflow.trace` on the simulation |
# MAGIC | **b** | Traces are OpenTelemetry and land in **Unity Catalog** | bind the experiment to a UC trace location; spans become governed Delta tables |
# MAGIC | **c** | Retrieve traces as **conversation history** | `search_traces` filtered by `mlflow.trace.user` / `mlflow.trace.session` |
# MAGIC | **d** | **Governance**: a user only sees traces they made | app pins the filter to the caller **+** a UC **row filter** on the trace table |
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Requirements
# MAGIC - MLflow 3 (`mlflow>=3.1`), `databricks-openai`, `databricks-agents`.
# MAGIC - **Store OpenTelemetry traces in Unity Catalog** enabled for the workspace
# MAGIC   (Previews page) — needed for section **b** onward.
# MAGIC - A UC `catalog.schema` you can create tables in (see `config.py`).

# MAGIC ## a · Framework autolog + a manual tool span
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `agent.py` calls `mlflow.openai.autolog()` at import — every LLM call is traced with
# MAGIC no code in the agent. The simulation is a plain Python function decorated with
# MAGIC `@mlflow.trace(span_type=TOOL)`, so it gets its own named span carrying the exact
# MAGIC parameters the model chose. MLflow auto-traces the ResponsesAgent's `predict` as the
# MAGIC root span, so **one turn is one trace** with the shape:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC predict (root)                     ← auto-traced by MLflow for the ResponsesAgent
# MAGIC  ├── Completions (LLM)             ← from mlflow.openai.autolog()
# MAGIC  ├── monte_carlo_simulation (TOOL) ← from @mlflow.trace

# MAGIC like any other UC table — grants, lineage, row filters, column masks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > **One-shot caveat.** A UC trace location can only be attached to an experiment that

# MAGIC ## d · Governance — a user only sees traces they made
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Two layers, defence in depth:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Application layer.** The app authenticates the caller (Databricks Apps forwards
# MAGIC    the end-user's identity) and *pins* the search filter to that identity. There is no
# MAGIC    code path that returns someone else's traces — see `app/app.py::history`.
# MAGIC 2. **Data layer (Unity Catalog).** Because the traces are a UC table, we enforce
# MAGIC    per-user isolation in SQL too, so it holds even for a direct query from a notebook,
# MAGIC    DBSQL, or a BI tool. **Schema reality check:** the OTel `_otel_spans` table is
# MAGIC    *per span*, and MLflow puts the user only on each trace's **root** span (as the
# MAGIC    OTel attribute `user.id`; session is `session.id`). A naive per-row filter on
# MAGIC    `user.id` would therefore hide every child LLM/TOOL span. The correct primitive is
# MAGIC    a **trace-scoped secure view**: resolve each trace's owner from its root span, then
# MAGIC    return *all* spans of the traces `current_user()` owns. Grant users the view, not
# MAGIC    the base table. Members of `TRACE_ADMIN_GROUP` see everything.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **a** — `mlflow.openai.autolog()` + `@mlflow.trace` gave every turn a clean span tree
# MAGIC   with the simulation as its own tool span. No trace code in the agent loop itself.
# MAGIC - **b** — one `set_experiment(trace_location=UnityCatalog(...))` call put the OTel
# MAGIC   spans into governed Delta tables you can query with SQL.
# MAGIC - **c** — `search_traces` filtered by user + session reconstructs a conversation; that
# MAGIC   *is* your chat history store, no separate database.
# MAGIC - **d** — the app pins the filter to the caller **and** a trace-scoped UC secure view
# MAGIC   enforces per-user isolation at the data layer, so governance doesn't depend on app code.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next: `app/` deploys this same agent as a Databricks App where each forecaster chats
# MAGIC and sees only their own history — governance **c** + **d** made concrete.
